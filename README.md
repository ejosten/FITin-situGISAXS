# FITin-situGISAXS
In-situ GISAXS analysis and simulation/fit software.  

The software enables rapid analysis of a large number of GISAXS data sets. In our case, this yields quantitative information on the time-resolved evolution of lattice constants, lattice constant distributions and tilt angles of the nanoparticle superlattices with respect to the substrate. Moreover, by quantification of the coherent and incoherent intensities, it is possible to quantify the relative ratio of nanoparticles in ordered assemblies/superlattices.  

The software run under the plot.py software https://sourceforge.net/projects/plotpy/.
